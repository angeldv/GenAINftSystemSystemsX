# GenAINftSystemSystemsX

## Description

A Solidity-based NFT marketplace contract employing Merkle tree-based whitelisting and on-chain SVG generation for dynamic, procedurally-generated NFT metadata, minimizing reliance on external storage.

## Features

- Generates unique NFT metadata using a transformer model fine-tuned on a curated art dataset.
- Implements a distributed storage solution for NFT assets using IPFS with content addressing and pinning.
- Integrates a decentralized identity (DID) system for NFT ownership verification and provenance tracking.
- Provides a REST API for programmatic access to NFT generation, minting, and management functions.
- Employs a dynamic pricing algorithm based on NFT rarity and market demand, utilizing on-chain oracles.
- Supports integration with various NFT marketplaces through standardized ERC-721 and ERC-1155 interfaces.
- Enables users to customize NFT rarity weights and feature distributions via a graphical user interface.
- Deploys smart contracts with upgradable architecture for future feature enhancements and bug fixes, using proxy patterns.
